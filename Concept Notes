Mastery Notes:

Gained by time spent in form + combat use.

Ki recovery consumables and items can temporarily improve maintenance.

Flight/instant transmission slows ki gain slightly.

Rage mechanic: repeated losses vs bosses may trigger early SSJ1 unlock.

5. Ki System & Consumables

Consumables & Items:

Ki recovery potions: emergency refill.

Ki charge boosters: crafted from boss drops or fragments.

Max ki boosters: one-time consumables for permanent max ki increase.

Ki weapon modifiers: boost damage, add debuffs, adjust ki consumption.

Race-specific items: Frieza race items can unlock Golden/Black forms.

Ki Mechanics:

Flat ki drain per form; reduced at max mastery.

Mastery reduces drain, increases damage/stability.

Ki recovery affected by movement, flight, or instant transmission.

6. Races & Special Traits

Saiyan (default)

Can unlock all SSJ forms, SSG, SSB, SSJ4.

Trait affinity: Legendary / Prodigy.

Frieza Race

+10–15% ki damage naturally.

Favored Traits: Legendary, Battle Genius.

Exclusive forms:

1st → Final Form

Golden Frieza

Black Frieza (post-game ultra-form)

Custom Races Concept

Any race can access forms.

Some favor traits naturally for mastery.

Optional custom abilities (race-specific buffs, ki efficiency, etc.).

7. Babidi / Majin Mechanics

Only players under Babidi see his messages.

Evil/Corrupted trait may trigger Majin path.

Players gain temporary stat boosts but can be “controlled” until mastery/quest completes.

No PvP influence; effects limited to player stats and AI behavior.

8. Optional Cutscenes

Minimal, safe for multiplayer.

Cannot interrupt boss fights or cause player death.

Triggered by:

Unlocking new form

Mentor milestones

Late-game Zeno/Grand Priest events

9. Rage Mechanic

Early-game rage (e.g., repeated deaths to Wall of Flesh) can temporarily push player into higher forms (e.g., SSJ1 early).

Temporary unlocks last until death; permanent unlocks gained under certain thresholds or milestones.

Acts like a revival item: restore ~50% HP, notify in chat.

Ki Weapons & Attacks

Include iconic attacks: Kamehameha, Spirit Bomb, basic Ki blasts/beams, etc.

Chargeable attacks consume more ki; damage scales with mastery and forms.

Players could have Ki Weapon upgrades via consumables or accessories (add debuffs, extra damage, faster charge).

Hakai (Energy of Destruction)

Possible outcomes:

Beerus/other Gods may use on players under certain conditions (e.g., pestering him, evil trait abuse).

If player can use:

Check energy cost, announce in chat (“<player>: Hakai!”).

Failure due to insufficient energy is local-only feedback.

Consider “Hakai resistance” for bosses to prevent instant one-shots.

Saiyan Tail Options

Optional cosmetic choice.

Could slightly improve ki control but doesn’t restrict form access.

Fusion Mechanics

Fusion Dance / Potara restrictions:

Requires related NPC friendship/mastery.

Player-only control; other participant is NPC.

Time-limited buffs for dance; Potara permanent unless involving a Kai.

Unlocks depend on forms of player and NPC (e.g., SSJ maxed → Gogeta/Vegito).

Babidi / Majin Control

Only affects players with appropriate trait (evil/corrupted).

Player can resist through mastery progression (like Vegeta).

Commands limited to flavor / buffs, no PvP.

Unique dialogue for Majin control events.

Zamasu (NPC for evil trait players)

Only interacts with “evil” trait players.

Provides power upgrades, form hints, or alternate questlines.

Beerus/Whis path unavailable for these players.

Beerus & Whis Mentor Interventions

Beerus: can discourage, threaten, or Hakai players if rules ignored or player is reckless.

Whis: training / mastery guidance, unlock god forms, balance evasion vs. power.

Zeno / Grand Priest Appearances

Triggered by specific conditions; reward could include trait reroll, hints, or unique blessings.

Interactions only grant specific wishes (e.g., “unlock next form,” “gain inner power”).

Super Saiyan 4 / Great Ape Mechanic

Must account for tail requirement and transformation conditions.

Optional temporary Great Ape form for SS4 unlock sequences.

Ki & Form Vendor

Dynamic stock based on world state and player form mastery.

Sells:

One-time consumables (permanent ki/max ki boost, reduced ki drain).

Temporary consumables (ki recovery, temporary buffs).

Accessories / weapon upgrades (damage, debuffs, mastery speed).

Dialogue reacts to player forms/traits.

Stock can rotate with world events or daily resets.

Custom Races

Optionally favor certain traits or paths (e.g., Frieza race → Golden/Black forms only accessible to them).

Do not restrict access to other forms outside their lore-based bonuses.

Addendum – Stagger / Knockback Resistance & Full Power Concept

Since Terraria doesn’t have a true “stagger” system, consider implementing knockback resistance instead.

While active, players hit by enemies/projectiles won’t be pushed back as far, but they still retain standard iFrames.

Could be tied to certain forms, transformations, or “power mode” states (example: Jiren’s Full Power, Frieza’s 100% Muscle form).

Balance testing required to ensure it doesn’t trivialize knockback-heavy bosses (e.g., Skeletron, Duke Fishron).

Full Power State

Functions as a transformation-style toggle.

Frieza-race: Accessed as “Final Form (100% Power)” with visual bulk-up.

Other races: May access through intensive training, but only in base form (not while transformed).

Consider limiting duration or giving stamina/ki drain to balance strength boost.

This state inherently grants knockback resistance as part of its identity.

Addendum – Stacking Kaioken with Transformations

Kaioken can be stacked with certain transformations, but not all.

Allowed forms:

Super Saiyan (base levels 1–3) → Compatible with Kaioken, though health drain increases significantly due to strain.

Super Saiyan Blue → Explicitly shown in canon (Goku). Stacking works, but severe HP drain and stamina burn apply.

Restricted forms:

Super Saiyan Blue Evolved → Kaioken incompatible, as the form already represents Vegeta’s mastery/strain bypass and stacking would be redundant.

Super Saiyan God, Super Saiyan 4, Ultra Instinct, or other “refined” states → Kaioken disallowed to reflect lore and avoid unbalanced mechanics.

Scaling effect:

Each tier of Kaioken multiplies the passive drain of the transformation by that level (Kaioken x5 = 5x HP/stamina drain).

Strain compounding makes reckless stacking risky but rewarding if pulled off.

Addendum – Kaioken Health Drain Mechanic

Kaioken should apply damage over time (DoT) in fixed 1 HP ticks.

Tick delay reduces as multiplier increases:

Kaioken x2 → slower tick interval, easier to manage.

Kaioken x10 → faster tick interval, noticeable drain.

Kaioken x20 → very fast tick interval, extremely punishing to sustain.

This scaling makes higher multipliers more risky to maintain without making the form unusable.

Health regen debuffs/interruptions significantly increase the danger at high multipliers, adding tactical considerations.

Stacking Kaioken with forms (e.g. Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan Blue) compounds risk, but shouldn’t instantly melt the player’s HP unless overused recklessly.
